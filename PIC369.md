## PIC 369-01: A Line, A Robot

**Project description:** Starting Fall 2021 I have been teaching an interdiscipinary course at Pratt Institute on using industrial robotics as a creative medium. The course was originally taught by a previous staff member at Pratt's Consortium for Research and Robotics, however upon receiving the teaching appointment I developed an entirely new syllabus to better address department outcomes and the unique conditions of hybrid digital+ in person teaching modalities.
